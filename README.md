# 🏗️ OOP Assignment

This repository contains solutions for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignment.  
The assignment demonstrates **class design, constructors, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism** in Python.

## 📌 Assignment Overview

### Activity 1: Design Your Own Class
- Created a `Smartphone` class with attributes and methods.
- Demonstrated use of a constructor to initialize objects.
- Added inheritance (e.g., `AndroidPhone`, `iPhone`).

### Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge 🎭
- Designed a `Vehicle` base class.
- Created subclasses (`Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`) that override the `move()` method differently.
- Demonstrated **polymorphism** by iterating over different vehicle objects and calling the same method (`move()`).
